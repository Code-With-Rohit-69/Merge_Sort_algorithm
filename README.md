This is Recursive Algorithm to sort an integer array in a particular manner named as <b>Merge Sort</b>.
<h2>Time Complexity: </h2>
<p>The time complexity of merge sort algorithm is O(nlog n), which is very good complexity in DSA world.</p>
<h2>Space Complexity: </h2>
<p>The space complexity of merge sort algorithm is O(n).</p>
